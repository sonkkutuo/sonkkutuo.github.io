<h1> Resume </h1>
         <p> I've worked mostly with teenagers, since all of my work experience is related to school. In 2021 
          I got a chance to direct a musical project for teenagers in my old school (Arabian peruskoulu). 
         <br> It was an amazing experience and I learned a lot from that! <br> It took a half a year to prepare everything before the practices started, the practices took 7 months and then we had the shows for a few weeks.
        <br>  I was responsible for pretty much everything (scripting, directing, writing lyrics, choreographing and also being on stage myself), but I did have amazing collegues so we worked as a team. <br> In 2023 I started doing teachers substitutes in my old school (once again, Arabian peruskoulu).
          I did gigs for a year, mostly for students from grades 6-9, but also one for 3rd graders. <br> I mainly taught english, history, social studies and religion.<br>
         Certificates: <br>
         I have a hygiene pass.</p>

         <p> Some of my skills: <br>
         I have many skills that are helpful in working life, for instance, good social skills, managing skills, time management, ability to work under pressure, experience from fast paced working environment, <br> language skills (fluent finnish, fluent english, basics from swedish, some understanding of russian.
