<h1> Resume </h1>
         <p> I've worked mostly with teenagers, since all of my work experience is related to school. In 2021 
          I got a chance to direct a musical project for teenagers in my old school (Arabian peruskoulu). 
         <br> It was an amazing experience and I learned a lot from that! It took a half a year to prepare everything before the practices started, the practices took 7 months and then we had the shows for a few weeks.
          I was responsible for pretty much everything (scripting, directing, writing lyrics, choreographing and also being on stage myself), but I did have amazing collegues so we worked as a team. In 2023 I started doing teachers substitutes in my old school (once again, Arabian peruskoulu).
          I did gigs for a year, mostly for students from grades 6-9, but also one for 3rd graders. I mainly taught english, history, social studies and religion.<br>
         Certificates: <br>
         I have a hygiene pass.</p>

         <p> Some of my skills: <br>
         I have many skills that are helpful in working life, for instance, good social skills, managing skills, time management, ability to work under pressure, experience from fast paced working environment, language skills (fluent finnish, fluent english, basics from swedish, some understanding of russian.
