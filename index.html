         Email address: sonjatuovinen@myy.haaga.helia.fi <br>
          <br>
         I have more information about myself on the two other pages 'Introduction' and on 'Resume'. In the introduction I tell a bit more about myself, my hobbies, lifestyle and personality. <br>
          In the resume on the other hand I focus mainly on my past job experiences and the skills I have. 
          All of these pages together will give the reader a somewhat good understanding of me as a person, as a student and as an employee.</p>
