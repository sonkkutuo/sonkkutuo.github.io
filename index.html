         I have more information about myself on the two other pages 'Introduction' and on 'Resume'. In the introduction I tell a bit more about myself, my hobbies, lifestyle and personality. 
          In the resume on the other hand I focus mainly on my past job experiences and the skills I have. 
          All of these pages together will give the reader a somewhat good understanding of me as a person, as a student and as an employee.</p>
         <h1>Introduction</h1>
         <p> As mentioned, I'm very passionate about sports and mainting an active and healthy lifestyle. However, there's much more to me. 
          For example, I love learning. Whether it's educational or learning about other people, I really love learning in general.
          I consider myself a very energetic, bubbly and open as a person. Being kind and polite at all times is something that's beyond important to me.
          About my freetime, I spend a lot of my freetime studying, working out, listening to music, taking care of myself and the people around me. 
          I also like to sped time with my dog. Right know most of my time I spend studying. 
          I am studying business information technology in Haaga-Helia, I'm currently a fresher. So far I've enjoyed my studies and learned so much. 
          I am a very responsible student, who works hard for achievements. Although I consider myself a talented student, I try to focus more on the learning side, and not just chasing after good grades. 
          Especially in the IT field, practical skills are very much appreciated. I do see myself working in the IT field in the furure. 
          I've been unemployed since I started my studies, but before that I've worked for a little.</p>
         <h1> Resume </h1>
         <p> I've worked mostly with teenagers, since all of my work experience is related to school. In 2021 
          I got a chance to direct a musical project for teenagers in my old school (Arabian peruskoulu). 
          It was an amazing experience and I learned a lot from that! It took a half a year to prepare everything before the practices started, the practices took 7 months and then we had the shows for a few weeks.
          I was responsible for pretty much everything (scripting, directing, writing lyrics, choreographing and also being on stage myself), but I did have amazing collegues so we worked as a team. In 2023 I started doing teachers substitutes in my old school (once again, Arabian peruskoulu).
          I did gigs for a year, mostly for students from grades 6-9, but also one for 3rd graders. I mainly taught english, history, social studies and religion.</p>

         <p> Some of my skills: <br>
         I have many skills that are helpful in working life, for instance, good social skills, managing skills, time management, ability to work under pressure, experience from fast paced working environment, language skills (fluent finnish, fluent english, basics from swedish, some understanding of russian.
