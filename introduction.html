           <h1>Introduction</h1> 
           <p> As mentioned, I'm very passionate about sports and mainting an active and healthy lifestyle. <br> However, there's much more to me. 
          For example, I love learning. <br>
          Whether it's educational or learning about other people, I really love learning in general. <br>
          I consider myself a very energetic, bubbly and open as a person. <br> Being kind and polite at all times is something that's beyond important to me.
          <br> About my freetime, I spend a lot of my freetime studying, working out, listening to music, taking care of myself and the people around me. <br>
          I also like to sped time with my dog. <br> Right know most of my time I spend studying. 
          I am studying business information technology in Haaga-Helia, I'm currently a fresher. <br> So far I've enjoyed my studies and learned so much. 
          I am a very responsible student, who works hard for achievements. <br> Although I consider myself a talented student, I try to focus more on the learning side, and not just chasing after good grades. 
         <br> Especially in the IT field, practical skills are very much appreciated. I do see myself working in the IT field in the furure. 
          I've been unemployed since I started my studies, but before that I've worked for a little.</p>
